### Very basic boiler plate for React && React-router using Babel && Webpack-dev-server

### -use NVM to install node (10.8.0)
### -clone project and open up editor into directory
### - run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
### -run `npm start` to start project (browser will open to :3000)

### - pay attention to `src/index.js`

### -SASS is being compiled to css

## NO production server is set! 
### It's for practice and learning basic setup for react and react-router
